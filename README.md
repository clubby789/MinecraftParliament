# MinecraftParliament
A Young Rewired State Project


A project to represent the votes in the House of Commons in Minecraft. It displays each MP as a block of their party's colour. Above them is a block representing which way they voted. It (when it is finished) will take voting data from data.parliament.uk. It was programmed on raspberry pi, and is designed to run with that version of Minecraft. It will work on the PC edition with the Raspberry Jam mod.
